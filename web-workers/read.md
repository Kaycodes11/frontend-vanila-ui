## There are three different type of web workers:

# dedicated workers: Here Workers will run for a single script
# shared workers: Here Workers can run for multiple scripts running from different window but *same domain or network

# service workers: This Worker sits between webapp, browser and network (if applicable); it is used for offline content, pwa, caching, running some heavy animation etc.
